## Abstract

Proof of Contract Stake (PoCS) is a staking system utilizing contract gas history introducing **code-mining** by incentivizing developers to secure the network. Contractsâ€™ stake scores depend on age, reputation, and gas use, deterring collusion attacks. Further information on PoCS Protocol Design are detailed in the [PoCS Research Page](https://jobyreuben.in/JOURNALS/pocs)

## Substrate Implementation

This [Substrate](https://substrate.io) Node is an adaptation of the [substrate-stencil](https://github.com/kaichaosun/substrate-stencil) to integrate PoCS protocol, which includes modified [pallet_contracts](https://auguth.github.io/pocs/target/doc/pallet_contracts/index.html) and [pallet_staking](https://auguth.github.io/pocs/target/doc/pallet_staking/) that supports Contract Staking Feature interoperable with current Substrate **NPoS-BABE-GRANDPA** public node infrastructure. 

## Build & Run PoCS Node

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/auguth/pocs
   ```

2. Run the Rust Setup Script

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Build the project in release mode:
   
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. Run the executable with the specified configuration:
   
    ```bash
    ./target/release/pocs --dev
    ```
5.  Use [Polkadot-JS-App](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) and [Contracts UI](https://contracts-ui.substrate.io/) to interact with the Node. Refer to [Testing Guide.md](/TESTING-GUIDE.md) for extended information.
